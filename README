This project provides a simple code library that can be used to play back motions recorded using
another one of my projects, the KinectXMLMotionRecorder(found at the link below), with Aldebaran
Robotic's Nao humanoid robot so motions recorded in humans can be played back using the Nao rather
than having to program the robot using proprietary software.

You will likely need Aldebaran's Naoqi.NET .dll, available only from Aldebaran, to do anything
useful with this code.

In-line documentation is provided for the majority of the code.
